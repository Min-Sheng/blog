> Persist till the end, and it will make you special!

In the summer vacation before I started my first semester of NTU CSIE Master's degree program, I participated in the **2018 IEEE Signal Processing Society Video and Image Processing (VIP) CUP**, which is an international competition about the **CT lung tumor segmentation task** held by IEEE Signal Processing Society.

It's a twisting and turning road for us to struggle through. From processing the CT(computed tomography) 3D image, analysing the data, building the baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, figuring out some potential challenges to trying every possible methods, everything tests our intelligence and perseverance.

The greatest challenges is that lung tumors may appear in any position in the patient's chest with any kind of sizes or shapes, which we identify as the scale and position variation problems, and the volume ratio between the tumor volumetric image and the remaining body volumetric image is very small, which means the data imbalance problem is especially severe in the dataset.

**Finally, we achieved to build an accurate, robust, and efficient model, and attain more precise segmentation results comparing to the state-of-the-art!**

I was so exicting to hear that we passed the first competetion stage and were selected to attend the final on the **IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) in Athens**!

In the meantime, I felt the enormous stress assailed me. It was the first time for me to present in English in such formal and significant occasion. Even though the stress suffered me, it make me quickly learn the presentation skills and help me establish the confidence for every presentations in the future.

It's my honor to win the **third place** in the final. Accomplishing this challenging tumor segmentation task is a milestone. I learned lots of deep learning techniques in the volumetric medical image processing, and tried all my best to overcome each problem. And I will keep doing AI reasearch to make contributions towards the health of humankind.

This experience also let me know one important thing: “**persist till the end, and it will make you special!**”

There have been several tough times I really wanted to give up, but I stick to it. Since the belief that everything will go well, I got the chance to stand on the dreamland, Greece, to share our efforts and achievement to the world!

So, next time when the fail frustrate you, don't say “I can't handle it” so fast. How about trying to persist a little bit more, maybe you will not only find that “I can get through it”, but also “I can do surprisingly well”.
