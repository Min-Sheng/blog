> Persist till the end, and it will make you special!

In the summer vacation before I started my first semester of NTU CSIE Master's degree program, I participated in the **2018 IEEE Signal Processing Society Video and Image Processing (VIP) CUP**, which is an international competition about the **CT lung tumor segmentation** task held by IEEE Signal Processing Society.

It's a twisting and turning road for us to struggle through. From processing the CT(computed tomography) image, analysing the data, building the baseline convolution neural network models, figuring out some challenges to trying every possible methods, everything tests our intelligence and perseverance.

The greatest challenges is that the lung tumor may appear in any position in the chest with any kind of size or shape, which we identify as the scale and position invariance problem, and the volume ratio between the tumor and the remain body image is very small, which means the data imbalance problem is especially severe in the dataset.

**Finally, we achieved to build an accurate, robust, and efficient model, and attain more precise segmentation results comparing to the state-of-the-art!**

I was so exicting to hear that we passed the first competetion stage and selected to attend the finals on the **IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) in Athens**!

It was the first time for me to present in English in such big international competetion. Even though the tremendous stress suffered me, it make me quickly learn the presentation skills and help me establish the confidence for each presentation in the future.

It's my honor to win the **third place** in the finals. Accomplishing this challenging tumor segmentation task is a milestone. I learned lots of deep learning techniques in the volumetric medical image processing, and tried all my best to overcome each problem. And I will keep doing AI reasearch to make contribution to the health of humankind.

This experience also let me know one important thing: “**persist till the end, and it will make you special.**”

There have been several tough times I really want to give up, but I stick to it. 
Since the belief that everything will go well, I got the chance to stand on the dreamland, Greece, 
to share our efforts and achievement to the world!
